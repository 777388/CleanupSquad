Program Addendum, remove the folders containing where this file is added, if run on a system that is not your own

Extremely Important Before you run be sure to set YOURHOSTID, or this will just delete the 2 parent folders

this can be done via using the python script socket.gethostname(). Copy what it gives you and set it there
